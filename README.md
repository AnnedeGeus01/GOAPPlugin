## GOAP (Goal Oriented Action Planning) plugin for Unreal Engine

# What is GOAP?

GOAP is an AI technique used to make game agents plan their actions dynamically based on goals and available conditions. Instead of pre-scripted behaviour like in Behaviour trees, a GOAP agent will decide its course of actions based on the world state it holds, what goals it wants to achieve and what actions the agent has. It will determine the best sequence of actions to reach those goals. This makes AI characters more flexible and adaptive, allowing them to respond intelligently to changing situations in the game world.
